- 🎯 In this notebook, I tried to write a script capable of transcribing youtube videos (audios in general) using the google's speech-to-text.
- ⚠️ Things to consider before using this notebook:
 > 1️⃣ **`This script is meant to be run in google colaboratory!`**
 
 > 2️⃣ This script can sometimes not detect text correctly, it's mainly due to noises or the way we speak in the video (speaking too fast or too slow)
 
 > 3️⃣ The general idea summary model is a community model available at [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) , it can sometimes get the general idea wrong, especially if there is a lack of data.
